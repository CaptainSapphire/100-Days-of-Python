# Day 13
Create a grade calculator. 
## Lesson Summary
No lesson, project day. 
## Challenge Directions
1. You are going to ask the user to type in the name of a test, the maximum score they could receive, and how many points they received. For example, your test could be called "Python Skills" and the maximum score is 50 points and the user receives 30 points out of 50 possible points.
2. Figure out the percentage the user received and round to 2 decimal places.
3. Use if/elif statements to show users the letter grade they received.
4. At the end, the user should see the letter grade they received and the percentage correct.
5. Add in emojis to celebrate their good grade or different colors depending on what you think is a good or bad final grade.
