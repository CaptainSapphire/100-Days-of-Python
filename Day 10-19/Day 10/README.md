# Day 10
A tip calculator- a necesity if you are learning to code. Wait! Nevermind- it's a split the bill calculator. Even more important (I say this unironically).
## Lesson Summary
No lesson. They do offer some background on how to do some tip math before hand and some practice. 
## Challenge Directions
1. Ask the user for the total bill amount.
2. Ask what % of tip they will leave to be added to the bill total.
3. Figure out how to get the total bill with tip then add that to original amount.
4. Ask the user how many people are splitting the bill and divide by the total.
