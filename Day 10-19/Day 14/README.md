# Day 14
Make a game of rock, paper, scissors. 
## Lesson Summary
No lesson, project day. 
## Challenge Directions
1. For this version, you have two players. Player 1 and Player 2.
You will need to create if statements (and probably nesting) to decide who has won, lost or if the game is a tie.
Make it fun and add emojis or epic comments as your players battle it out.
Keep it simple for you. Don't expect the user to type in the words rock, paper, scissors. Instead, encourage them to use R, P, or S. (Can you ensure the user can still input an option even if it is typed in wrong?)
