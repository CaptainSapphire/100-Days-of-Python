# Day 18
We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

## Lesson Summary
No lesson, project day.

## Challenge Directions
1. Start by picking a number between 0 and 1,000,000. This will be your first variable.
2. Create a while loop to keep asking the user to guess your number.
3. If they are too low, tell them "too low." If they guess too high tell, them "too high."
4. If the user guesses correctly, tell them they are a winner (maybe add a fun emoji too!)
5. Count the number of attempts it took for the user to guess number. Make sure you only show that after they get the answer correct.
Extra challenge: If the user types a negative number, exit program.
