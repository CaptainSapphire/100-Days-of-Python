# Day 19
We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

## Lesson Summary
A while loop is perfect to use when we don't know how many times we want the loop to repeat.

If we have an idea of how many times we want the loop to repeat, we can use a for loop to loop code in exactly the same way the while loop did.

The range function creates a list of numbers in the range you create. If you only give it one number, it will start at 0 and move to a state where the final number is one less than the number in the brackets. 


## Challenge Directions
A common thing people do is borrow money. When people repay money, they pay interest which is paid back annually and added to the original amount the person borrowed.

You are going to create a loan calculator that shows how much money you owe for a loan of $1,000 with a 5% APR (APR is fancy for Annual Percentage Rate) over 10 years.

This means each year the amount of money you owe will increase 5%.

Figure out how much you owe altogether for 10 years?

Use a for loop and one or two lines of looped code to determine the answer. (Hint: Don't make this overcomplicated. It should only be a few lines of code altogether.)
