# Day 15
All about Loops.
## Lesson Summary
A while loop allows your code to repeat itself based on a condition you set.
It is similar to an if statement in that you ask a question, and as long as the answer is true, the computer will repeatedly run the code.

## Challenge Directions
Write a program that loops. Inside the loop, ask the user what animal sound they want to hear. Example: 

```
What animal do you want?: Cow
A cow goes moo.

Do you want to exit?: no

What animal do you want?: A Lesser Spotted lemur
Ummm...the Lesser Spotter Lemur goes awooga.

Do you want to exit?: yes
```
