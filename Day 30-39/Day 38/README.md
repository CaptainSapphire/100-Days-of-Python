# Day 38
## Lesson Summary
#### Using a for loop
 This for loop creates a variable called letter. It is used to store each character in the string as the loop goes through it, starting at the first character.<br><Br>

The print statement uses the letter variable and will output the string one character at a time (like a list).
```
myString = "Day 38"
for letter in myString:
  print(letter)
# This code outputs:
#D
#a
#y
#3
#8
# this is a comment in the code, the computer will ignore it
```
This means that we can do certain things to certain characters inside the loop.
### if statement inside the loop
ðŸ‘‰ This code will examine the lower case version of each character. If it's an 'a', the computer will change the font color to yellow before printing.<br><Br>

Outside of the loop, the last line sets the font color back to default for the next character in the loop.
```
myString = "Day 38"
for letter in myString:
  if letter.lower() == "a":
    print('\033[33m', end='') #yellow
  print(letter)
  print('\033[0m', end='') #back to default
# This code outputs (with a yellow 'a'):
#D
#a
#y
#3
#8
```

### Using a list to specify search items
ðŸ‘‰ If the letters are in my list called vowels, they will print out in yellow.<br><br>

I changed the print statement on the last line back to the default color with the ending system.
```
vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
myString = "Will my vowels now be yellow?"
for letter in myString:
  
  if letter.lower() in vowels:
    print('\033[33m', end='') #yellow
    
  print(letter, end="")
  print('\033[0m', end='') #back to default
```

## Challenge Directions
Code the rainbow!<br><br>

- Ask the user to input any sentence (string).
- Now we'll rainbow-ize (nope, me neither) it.
- As soon as the string contains an 'r', every letter from that point on should be red.
- When the computer encounters a 'b', 'g', 'p' or 'y', from there the output should be blue for 'b', green for 'g'...you get the idea.
- Loop through the string and output it (so the color continues through the loop).
- The output should change color every time it encounters a new r,g,b,p or y.
- ðŸ¥³ Extra points for resetting the output color back to default every time there's a space.
