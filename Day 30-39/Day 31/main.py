##NOTES FROM THE CREATOR
# this is not the most ideal way to do this, however, this is how I worked it out. The solution is very different, but this is the one I made. Overall, I did do a good job. 
#Also, the colors are very different from the desired, however, from the looks of it, the colors in the example have a different background, so it is possible we are running different versions. 
#When I archive this to Github, make sure to add the interfaces (from the directions) as reference points
