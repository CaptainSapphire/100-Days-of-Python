# Day 1 
An introduction to Python, Replit, and print statements. 

## Lesson

### A tour of the Replit workspace
**Tutorial**: this is accesible from the ðŸ“– (9) icon. You will find video transcript and helper code here.\
**File**s: if you need to view a different file, just click on it here. This is also where you can upload any assets (pictures, gifs, etc.) to use in your project.\
**Coding window**: where you will do most of your typing, all your code will be added here, you can also view files here\
**Console**: shows you the output of the program (anything we tell our program to show to our users will appear here)\
**Run**: will make your codeâ€¦ well, run\
**Publish**: share your code with our community for others to see and remix\
**Invite**: allow someone else to edit your code live in multiplayer\
**Hamburger**: This button brings up the tutorial pane if you've closed it
Your video tutorial, play through and pause when asked to build up your coding skills!\

### Print statements
You just learned your first command: the print statement. It says "Print out whatever's in my brackets". The print statement is how you get your program to put messages in the console.

## Challenge Directions
1. Write your `full name` and `today's date` in separate lines of code.
2. Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just the one `print` statement! (See below)*
3. On the next line add `I am feeling` with an emoji of your choice to illustrate how you're feeling about the challenge.
4. Add one more line to your output `You can follow my progress at replit.com/@ ` and add in your Replit username. This will be a great way of maintaining accountability for yourself!
5. Run your program.
