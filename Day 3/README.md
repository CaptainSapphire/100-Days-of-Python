# Day 3
An introduction to *Concatenate* in Python. 

## Lesson
### Concatenate
All it really means is combine text (remember, text is called a string) and variables together into single sentences!
It turns out print has a super-power. We can give it as many different things to print as we want. All we need to do is put a comma , between every different thing in the ().
**You can combine as many things as you want in any order you want, as long as they're separated by that comma!**
Example:
`print(food + " with " + plant + " and a side of " + method + " " + burn + " " + item)`
