# Day 8
A project day.

## Lesson Summary
There was no lesson, this involved using what we learned up to this point.

## Challenge Directions
Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:

- input and output
- concatenation
- if statements
- nested if statements
- Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week.

Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favorite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.
