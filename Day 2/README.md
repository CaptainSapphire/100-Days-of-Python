# Day 2 
An introduction to *input* in Replit using Python. 

## Lesson Summary
### Input
Input is when the user gives information to the computer.
It's very similar to the `print` command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter.
### Variables
`input` asks for something, takes it, but then has nowhere to put it. We can change that with a `variable` which is a value that we can use to name and store data.
You can give a variable any name you want, but you can't use spaces. You can use underscores or camelCase. You can print your variable using `print` and the name you used for your variable in your input command. \
To print your variable, insert it into the `print()` without quotes. 

## Challenge Directions
Write code that does the following:
1. Asks for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live (or you can create other questions!)
2. Store all of the answers in different variables.
3. Print out a full sentence that includes the user's favorite things.
4. Give them a positive affirmation at the end - tell them they rock at doing something!
