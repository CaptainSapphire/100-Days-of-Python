# Day 5
Imagine you are in a dimly lit, beige room, generally bland, square, and small. 
A figure steps out of the shadows, into the only light of the room. 
You are being interrogated, to see if you one of the escapees from none other than Arkham Asylum.
This is a program built out of python if and else statements- nothing too much to say out of it. I did quite a bit of nesting, however,
I have prior experience in Python. 

## Lesson Summary
### If Statements
You are telling the computer: if something is true, then do this specific block of code. 
Double equals (==) is asking the computer to compare if these two things are exactly the same.
### Else
If the condition is not met with the if statement, then we want the computer to do the else part instead. 
Likewise, if the condition is met in the if statement, then the else bit is ignored by the computer. 
The else statement must be the first thing unindented after the if statement and in line with it.

## Directions for the Challenge
1. Ask your users a series of questions that identify if they're one of the characters in the world you have created.
2. Add multiple if statements to check the result of each question.
3. Make sure to have a final print if they haven't selected any of the characters so far.
