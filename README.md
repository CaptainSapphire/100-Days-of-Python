# 100 Days of Python
Projects I made for the Replit 100 days of code course!

## Important Notices
The code is my own, feel free to fork, but please, if you complete the course, I encourage and endorse for you to learn it and write it yourself. 
Everything under the ##Lesson header is NOT MINE. I have it as a quick reference for the future and to document what I learned.
