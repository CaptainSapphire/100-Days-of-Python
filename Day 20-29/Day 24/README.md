# Day 24

## Lesson Summary
You can send information to subroutines using parameters. These can make the subroutines do different things based on different inputs. In a subroutine, the () are for the argument (argument is another word for parameter). 
These are the pieces of information we pass to the code. These can be variable names that are made up for the first time within the argument ().

You add parameters as such:
```
def whichCakes(ingredients);
whichCake(carrot):
```

## Challenge Directions
Let's build an infinity dice!

Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides (essentially as big of a number as you like). Write one subroutine with one parameter that allows us to call a function (such as rollDice).
```
Example:

Infinity Dice ðŸŽ²

How many sides?: 600
You rolled 532

Roll again? yes
You rolled 102

Roll again? no
```
