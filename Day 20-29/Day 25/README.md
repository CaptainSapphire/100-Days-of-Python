# Day 25

## Lesson Summary
The return command sends some information back to the part of the code that called it. This means the function call is replaced with whatever was returned.
We saw this before with importing libraries and random numbers. We could use the random number wherever we wanted.


## Challenge Directions
et's extend Day 24's project and create a health stats generator for a character in a video game.

Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
Then, create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice.
Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together and return that subroutine as a character's health stats for a video game.
Print out the character's health stats.
Add a loop to give the user the option to generate health stats for another character.
(We genuinely see this in video games!)

🥳 Extra points if you ask for the character's name and double extra points if you use different colors!
