# Day 22
Learning about libraries + incorporating the *random* library.

## Lesson Summary
Libraries are collections of code that other people have written. We can use a library by writing import and then the library name.

## Challenge Directions
Copy and paste your code from Day 18.

We are going to make a change to this project:

Make the number generator completely random between 1 and 1,000,000. Now, the game will always have the user guess a random number each time (now the user can't cheat...)
```
Totally Random One-Million-to-One

What is your guess?: 500000
Too low

What is your guess?: 750000
Too high

What is your guess?: 600000
Too low

What is your guess?: 650000
Correct!

It took you 4 guesses to get the number correct.
Click 'run' to try again with a different number.
