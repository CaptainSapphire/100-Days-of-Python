# Day 3
An introduction to *Concatenate* in Python. 

## Lesson Summary
### Concatenate
All it really means is combine text (remember, text is called a string) and variables together into single sentences!
It turns out print has a super-power. We can give it as many different things to print as we want. All we need to do is put a comma , between every different thing in the ().
**You can combine as many things as you want in any order you want, as long as they're separated by that comma!**
Example:
`print(food + " with " + plant + " and a side of " + method + " " + burn + " " + item)`

## Directions
1. Create these as a variable:
- A type of food
- A type of plant
- A method of cooking
- A word to describe burned food
- A household item
2. Output a nice looking Recipe page that *concatenates* a dish in this format:
- `cooking` `food` with `burned` `plant` on a bed of `item`
