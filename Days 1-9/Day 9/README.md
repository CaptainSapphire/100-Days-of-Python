# Day 9

## Lesson Summary 
*Casting* is where we explicitly tell the computer that what we are typing is a number and not a letter.\
*int* is where we are telling the computer, "This is not text. Please convert this to a whole number."\
*float* is the same as int, but as a decimal. 

## Challenge Directions
