# Day 6
I created a "secure login" program- this was to learn to use elif statements in combination with if and else statements. 
## Lesson Summary 

The elif command (which stands for 'elseif') allows you to ask hundreds questions using the same input! 
You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they *must* go in between if and else and have the same indentation. 
## Challenge Directions
1. Create a program where someone logins with their username and password correctly and then gets a lovely individual greeting.
2. Write a specific personalized greeting for 3 different people.
3. Don't forget an else statement for everyone else who shouldn't be logging in.
